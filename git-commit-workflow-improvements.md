After reviewing our interactions, here are several potential improvements to the git commit workflow:

1. File Change Detection
    - Currently, we manually check git status and diff
    - [x] Could automate the initial scan of changes and populate pending-changes.md
    - [x] Add line count changes automatically (added/removed lines)
    - [x] Calculate percentage of file changed
2. Table Formatting
    - The table alignment fixes were done manually several times
    - [x] Could enforce consistent column widths from the start
    - [x] Add automatic table formatting when updating pending-changes.md
    - [x] Consider using a more structured template with pre-aligned columns
3. Commit Message Structure
    - Could enforce stricter conventional commit types (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
    - [x] Add validation for commit message format
    - Include scope in commit messages (e.g., type(scope): message)
    - Add optional footer for breaking changes
4. Change Grouping
    - Could suggest logical grouping of related changes
    - [x] Warn if unrelated changes are being committed together
    - Provide option to split changes into separate commits
5. Template Management
    - Current template is recreated each time
    - [x] Could store template in a separate file (git-workflow.py in .git directory)
    - Add template versioning
    - Include more structured sections (Breaking Changes, Dependencies, etc.)
6. User Experience
    - [x] Add clear prompts for each step
    - Provide preview of commit before execution
    - Add option to amend previous commit
    - Show diff summary in a more readable format
